Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

**The gaming room wanted their game to be distributed online to multiple players. They needed their program to support this.**
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
**I did particularly well in implementing the design patterns that allowed multiple games to be created with unique IDs**
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
**Setting up the requirments and summarizing the goals was very helpful. Putting the requirments into a bullet list was an easy way to see what all needed to be done. Listing the constraints in the same way allowed me to keep those in mind while planning for the requirements**
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
**The table where we listed different Operating Systems and their qualities. As I learn more about different Operating Systems, such comparisons will become easier.**
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
**A lot of people feel they know better then their clients. You see this a lot on house designing shows. Most of the time, the person hates the results, because the designer completely disregarded what the client wanted and designed what they wanted. Software development is a lot like that. If you don't fullfill your clients expectations, there will be conflict. Doing a good job means delivering the product you were paid to make.**
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
**As a novice, I just followed the directions, so there wasn't too much strategizing. For the fourth project, where the instructions were too lacking to actually follow, it did take a hefty amount of analyzing to figure out what to do. In that case, I had to carefully compare the tutorial code with the code we were given to see if they matched up anywhere. I could then work out what needed to be done by looking at the tutorial.**
